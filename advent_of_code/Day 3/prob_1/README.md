# 🧮 Day 3: ASCII Memory Repair - Part 1 🛠️

## The Problem 🔍

While investigating memory corruption in your ship's computer, you find some intact but corrupted data sequences. Each sequence appears to contain multiplication instructions in the format `mul(x,y)`, but they're mixed with random characters and symbols.

### Example 🌟

```
xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
```

The valid multiplications in this sequence are:
- `mul(2,4)` = 8
- `mul(11,8)` = 88
- `mul(8,5)` = 40

The sum of all valid multiplication results is 136.

## Task 📝
Parse these corrupted sequences and find the sum of all valid multiplication results.

### Implementation Details 🔧
- Only process multiplication instructions in the format `mul(x,y)`
- Valid numbers are between 1-999
- Ignore malformed instructions
- Sum all valid multiplication results

### Solution ✨

Total: 196826776
